# Listing Automation Bot

## About Project

This is a bot I created that automates login and listing submission on Carousell, made using **Python** and **Selenium**. I found it tedious to have to manually fill in the listing submission form every time I wanted to list an item, especially when it's an item that's already listed, that I am just listing again to bump it up. Hence, I made this to handle that for me.

## Features

- Login
- Upload image
- Fill in form
- Submit form

## Skills Used/Learned

Through this project, I learnt how to use Selenium and practice some Python.

## To-do
